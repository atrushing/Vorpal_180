A 400mm printer is needed to print the side frames in one solid piece. There are also two-piece side frames that can fit on a 350mm printer.
There has been no shrinkage compensation applied to these pieces as different printers and filaments will have different shrink factors. Check the Tools folder for the calibration_square and follow the process in the manual to calculate a good print scale.
